# Implementation of "BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases"
### Marsich Gaia
In this work I read and studied the paper ["BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases"](https://github.com/gmarsich/BIRCH/blob/main/BIRCH_clustering.pdf) and proposed a first implementation of the BIRCH algorithm.
