# Implementation of "BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases"
### [Marsich Gaia] (https://github.com/gmarsich)
In this work I read and studied the paper ["BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases"](https://github.com/gmarsich/BIRCH/blob/main/BIRCH_clustering.pdf) and proposed a first implementation of the BIRCH algorithm.

The folder `code` contains the file `UL.ipynb`, that exploits the methods in `CFTree_methods.py` and in `side_methods.py` to run the BIRCH algorithm.

The folder `data` collects the results (as images) given by `UL.ipynb`.
