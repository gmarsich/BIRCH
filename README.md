# Unsupervised Learning - Project on "BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases"
### Marsich Gaia [SM3500600]
This repository collects the files concerning the final project developed for the "Unsupervised Learning" course. I read and studied the paper ["BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method for Very Large Databases"](https://github.com/gmarsich/BIRCH/blob/main/BIRCH_clustering.pdf) and proposed an implementation of the BIRCH algorithm (that, however, may be better refined).
